# Gaze-Detection

## About
The code is based on the Gaze controlled keyboard tutorials from PySource. It detects whether the pupils are looking left, center, or right. I added cheek turn direction which likewise tells whether the face is facing left, center, or right.

## Installation
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python
pip install cmake
pip install dlib
```

## How To Run
```bash
python main.py
```
